# HomeTeam Network: AI Engineer Take-Home Project
## Simple Sports Motion Detection

### Project Overview
Implement a basic motion detection system for sports video that identifies and highlights areas of activity. This project is designed to be completed in 2-3 hours and focuses on your Python skills, basic computer vision knowledge, and code organization.

### Task Description
Build a small program that processes a short sports video clip to detect motion and visualize the results. We've intentionally scoped this to be straightforward while still demonstrating relevant skills.

### Project Requirements

#### 1. Video Processing
- Load and process a provided short sports video clip (10 seconds)
- Extract frames at a regular interval (e.g., 5 fps)
- Basic image preprocessing (resize to a standard resolution)

#### 2. Motion Detection
- Implement a simple frame differencing algorithm to detect motion
- Apply basic filtering to reduce noise
- Draw bounding boxes around areas with significant movement

#### 3. Results Visualization
- Create a visualization showing:
  - Original frame
  - Detected motion areas with bounding boxes
- Save the output as a series of images or a video

#### 4. Documentation
- Write clear comments in your code
- Create a README explaining:
  - How to run your code
  - Your approach and any design decisions
  - Any challenges you encountered
  - Simple ideas for future improvements

### Project Materials
We will provide:
- A sample 10-second sports video clip
- A starter code template with basic utilities (optional to use)

### Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate your submission based on:
1. **Code Quality**: Clean, readable code with appropriate organization
2. **Functionality**: Successfully detecting meaningful motion in the video
3. **Documentation**: Clear explanation of your approach
4. **Problem-Solving**: How you handle challenges like noise or camera movement

### Submission Instructions
1. Create a private GitHub repository
2. Commit your code with clear commit messages
3. Include a README.md with your documentation
4. Share the repository with my GitHub account: `msvhsn-htn`

### Time Expectation
This project is designed to take 2-3 hours. We're looking for clean, functioning code rather than a complex solution.
